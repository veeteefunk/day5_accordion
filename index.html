                <p>Formulate what you want to work on during the challenge. 
                It might be - learning a framework, or starting a journey of 
                learning to code, or improving your skill level with a particular 
                technology or a programming language. Donâ€™t spend too much time 
                planning, but having a plan like this will help you on your path.

                <p>Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter 
                    or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting 
                    updates on their progress, supporting them when things get 
                    difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and 
                    effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each 
                    person involved.
